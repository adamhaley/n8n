This repository is to store all things related to my n8n automation life:

1) n8n workflows

2) working apache / docker config for self-hosted n8n

3) speech-to-text and text-to-speech server in Flask that uses (for now) openai for transcribing and cartesia for tts

4) random services I think up to support n8n workflows, usually invoked by the http node

You may say I'm a dreamer. But I'm not the only one
